## TechZap

TechZap is a frontend ecommerce website which sells tech products. This website was built to enhance my ReactJs skills and to showcase an interactive and modern interface with some UI/UX techniques.

## Technologies

Built with ReactJs and Tailwind CSS, TechZap features a dynamic slider, dropdown menus and button animations to enhance user interaction. It showcases my understanding of React components and Tailwind's utility-first design, while also making sure the website is fully responsive.
